CLERK: Command-Line Executor for Rapid Knowledge
================================================

The CLERK project is a pivotal component of the `PHOTON platform`_, a suite of
tools committed to gathering, processing, and publishing knowledge. Inspired by
Douglas Engelbart's vision of the computer as a "clerk" in his seminal paper,
`Augmenting Human Intellect`_, CLERK is a powerful command-line tool, designed
to provide situational awareness and context-sensitive operations based on the
current working directory (CWD) and the information it contains.

Here are the roles of CLERK, each fulfilling a unique function within the
knowledge management process:

- `Progenitor`_: Sparks life into Python projects.
- `Modulator`_: Shapes Python modules and packages.
- `Projector`_: Illuminates project documentation.
- `Executor`_: Structures to-dos for efficiency.
- `Formulator`_: Blueprints dialogs on Textual.
- `Curator`_: Organizes git/archive management.
- `Condensor`_: Summarizes content with AI assistance.
- `Memorator`_: Preserves project milestones.

By being context-aware, CLERK can suggest relevant operations based on the CWD,
making workflows smoother and more efficient. This context-sensitive approach
elevates CLERK from a mere assistant to an enhancer of smarter workflows and a
partner in intellectual work.

As a part of the `PHOTON platform`_, CLERK contributes to the overarching mission
of knowledge gathering, processing, and publishing. It embodies the platform's
vision of enhancing work efficiency, productivity, and insight through
leveraging technology. In the spirit of Engelbart's vision, CLERK is designed
to augment your intellect, enabling you to focus on what matters most: creating
and sharing knowledge.

About PHOTON Platform
---------------------

The `PHOTON platform`_ is part of a comprehensive vision by `phi ARCHITECT`_ to
establish a system architecture for gathering, processing, and publishing
living digital archives. It is an integrated suite of open-source tools,
curated and customized for efficient and effective knowledge management.

Gather • Process • Publish
--------------------------
*Tools to shine brighter*

The `PHOTON platform`_, along with sister organizations `GEOMETOR`_ and `HARMONIC
resonance`_, works under the guiding principle of transforming complex
hierarchical content into accessible knowledge. With the aim of making order
and organization integral to the framework, the `PHOTON platform`_ thrives on
achieving mastery in all practices required for the mission.

For more details on the platform and its various projects, please visit our
`website`_ or explore our `GitHub organization`_.

The `PHOTON platform`_ is one of three orgs that `phi ARCHITECT`_ manages:

`GEOMETOR`_
