CLERK: Command-Line Executor for Rapid Knowledge
================================================

The CLERK project is a key component of the PHOTON platform, a suite of tools
dedicated to the mission of gathering, processing, and publishing knowledge.
CLERK is a powerful command-line tool, inspired by Douglas Engelbart's vision
of a computer as a "clerk" - an administrative assistant that aids in every
step of your work. It is designed to provide situational awareness within the
terminal, offering relevant operations based on the context of the current
working directory (CWD) and the information at hand.

CLERK is designed to augment human capabilities, particularly in managing
knowledge. Its role encompasses several key functions, each serving as a vital
link in the chain of managing, executing, and keeping records of tasks.

The roles of CLERK:

- **Progenitor**: Gives birth to new Python projects, serving as a springboard
  for fresh ideas.
- **Modulator**: Handles the creation, management, and publication of Python
  modules and packages, ensuring the seamless flow of Python projects.
- **Projector**: Manages project documentation, keeping your project's
  knowledge base organized and up-to-date.
- **Executor**: Manages to-do lists, ensuring tasks are carried out efficiently.
- **Curator**: Manages git/archive, maintaining the record of your projects
  over time.
- **Condensor**: Provides AI-assisted summaries of content at URLs, offering
  quick insight into web content.
- **Memorator**: Records important facts in a project as they occur, ensuring
  that no critical information falls through the cracks.
- **Formulator**: Provides blueprint-driven dialogs on Textual, streamlining
  your command-line interactions.

By being aware of the context of your current working directory, CLERK can
suggest relevant operations, facilitating smooth and efficient workflows. This
context-sensitive approach makes it more than just an assistant; it's an
enabler of smarter workflows and a partner in your intellectual journey.

As a part of the PHOTON platform, CLERK contributes to the overarching mission
of gathering, processing, and publishing knowledge. It's a testament to the
platform's vision of making work more efficient, productive, and insightful
through the powerful leveraging of technology. In the spirit of Engelbart's
vision, CLERK is designed to augment your intellect, extending your
capabilities, and enabling you to focus on what matters most: creating and
sharing knowledge.

About PHOTON Platform
---------------------

The PHOTON platform is part of a comprehensive vision by `phi ARCHITECT`_ to
establish a system architecture for gathering, processing, and publishing
living digital archives. It is an integrated suite of open-source tools,
curated and customized for efficient and effective knowledge management.

Gather • Process • Publish
--------------------------
*Tools to shine brighter*

The PHOTON platform, along with sister organizations `GEOMETOR`_ and `HARMONIC
resonance`_, works under the guiding principle of transforming complex
hierarchical content into accessible knowledge. With the aim of making order
and organization integral to the framework, the PHOTON platform thrives on
achieving mastery in all practices required for the mission.

For more details on the platform and its various projects, please visit our
`website`_ or explore our `GitHub organization`_.

The `PHOTON platform`_ is one of three orgs that `phi ARCHITECT`_ manages:

`GEOMETOR`_
Model • Reveal • Render
-----------------------

*Exploring the architecture of all that is*

- `GitHub <https://github.com/geometor>`_

`HARMONIC resonance`_
Generate • Resonate • Orchestrate
---------------------------------

*Tools to vibrate pixels and speakers*

- `GitHub <https://github.com/harmonic-resonance>`_
