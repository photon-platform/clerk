# CLERK

A command-line tool for situational awareness and context-sensitive operations.

## Overview

CLERK (Command-Line Executor for Rapid Knowledge) provides context-sensitive operations based on the current working directory and its contents.

CLERK is the central tool of the PHOTON platform, integrating the functionality of several other tools into a single, cohesive CLI.

We are currently working towards tighter integration with the Gemini CLI.

## Integrated Tools

-   **build**: Shapes Python modules and packages.
-   **curate**: Organizes git/archive management.
-   **log**: Creates log entries.
-   **gather**: Gathers content from various sources.
